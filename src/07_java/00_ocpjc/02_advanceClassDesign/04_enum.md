### enum 
* enums are public, static and final
* valueOf() and name() methods to the enum element to return the bane of the enum element
* if you declare an enum within a class, then it is by default static.
* cannot use the new operator on enum data types, even inside enum class
* compare 2 enumerations using == operator
* if enumeration constants are from two different enumerations, the equals() method does not return true
* toString() prints the name of the enumeration constant
* static values() method return an array of the enumeration
* enumeration constants cannot be cloned
