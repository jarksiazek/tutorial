###Job
* Create a job named pi with image perl that runs the command with arguments "perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'"
  * ```kubectl create job pi --image=perl -- perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'```
* Wait till it's done, get the output
  * ```kubectl get jobs -w```
  * ```kubectl logs job/pi```
* Create a job with the image busybox that executes the command 'echo hello;sleep 30;echo world'
  * ```kubectl create job busybox --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c echo hello;sleep 30;echo world```
* Follow the logs for the pod (you'll wait for 30 seconds)
  * ```kubectl get jobs```
  * ```kubectl logs busybox-*** -f```
* See the status of the job, describe it and see the logs
  * ```kubectl get jobs```
  * ```kubectl describe job busybox```
  * ```kubectl logs job busybox```
* Delete the job
  * ```kubectl delete job busybox```
* Create a job but ensure that it will be automatically terminated by kubernetes if it takes more than 30 seconds to execute
  * ```kubectl create job busybox --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c echo hello;sleep 30;echo world```
  * ```Add job.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds=30```
* Create the same job, make it run 5 times, one after the other. Verify its status and delete it 
  * ```kubectl create job busybox --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c echo hello;sleep 30;echo world```
  * ```Add job.spec.completions=5```
* Create the same job, but make it run 5 parallel times
  * ```kubectl create job busybox --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c echo hello;sleep 30;echo world```
  * ```Add job.spec.parallelism=5```
