### Changing instance type
* stop instance
* Instance settings -> Change instance type
* start instance

### Enhance Networking
* installed on new generation instances i.e. t3 
* EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
  * Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), low latency 
  * Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100 Gbps
  * Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - LEGACY
  * Works for new generation instances 
* Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
  * Improved ENA for HPC, only Linux
  * inter-node communications, tighly coupled workloads 
  * Bypasses the underlying Linux OS - low latancy, reliable transport

### Placement groups
EC2 -> Network & Security -> Placement Groups 
* uses for controlling EC2 placement strategy
* 3 strategies:
  * cluster - low-latency in a single AZ, same rack (hardware)
  * spread - max 7 instances per group per AZ - good for critical apps, minimal failure risk
  * partition - many different partitions (hawdwars), spread many different partitions and AZ's, big data apps

### OS Shutdown signal on EC2
* Options
  * Stop (Default) 
  * Terminate (Can be set up from CLI)    

### Termination protection
* protection does not work when shutdown OS is "terminate"

### EC2 Troubleshooting
* InstanceLimitExceeded - max number of vCPUs per region
  * only apply to running on-demand and spot instances 
  * default is 64 vCPUs - use different region or request AWS 
* InsufficientInstanceCapacity
  * not enough On-Demand capacity in AZ
  * resolution
    * wait couple mins 
    * request instances one by one
    * instance smaller instance now, and then resize it
    * take different AZ
* Instance Terminates Immediately
  * EBS limit
  * An EBS snapshot is corrupt
  * the root EBS volume is encrypted and you have permission to KMS for decryption

### EC2 Purchasing options
* On-Demand Instances - pay by second
* Reserved (1 or 3 yrs)
 * reserved instances - long workload
 * convertible of instance  
* Saving Plans (1 or 3 yrs) - commitment to an amount of usage
* Spot instance - short workloads, cheap, less reliable  
* dedictaed hosts - physical server
* dedicated instances - no other customer will share your hardware
* capacity reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ 

### Spot instance
* 90% discount
* define max spot price 
* spot block
 * block spot instance during a specified time frame 

### Spot fleet
* spot fleets = set of Spot Instances + optional On-demand

### Burstable Instances T2/T3
* limited burst credit can be changed to unlimited - extra pay

### Elastic IPs
* fixed public IP
* dont pay for it if it is attached
* default is 5 EIPs per account 

### CloudWatch metrics
* AWS metrics 
 * basic monitoring - 5 mins interval
 * detailed monitoring - extra paid - 1 mins interval
 * CPU(+ Creadit Balance), Network(In/Out), Disk, Status Check Metrics(Instance status, System status)
 * RAM is not included
* Custom metrics
 * Basic Resolution: 1 min resolution
 * High Resolution: up to 1 sec resolution
 * include RAM, application level metrics
 * IAM permissions on the EC2 

### Unified CloudWatch Agent
* EC2, on-premises
* collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, process, disk etc
* collect logs and send to CloudWatch Logs
 * default setting are not able to send logs without agent
 * agent configuration can be stored in SSM Parameter Store
 * collect metric and monitor system utilization of individual processes

### Status Checks
* System Status Checks 
 * issues with AWS System (eg. physical host, loss of system power)
 * check personal health dashboard for any scheduled critical maintenance
* Instance Status Checks
 * monitors software/network configuration 
 * resolutino - reboot the instance or change instance configuration

### HIBERNATE
* STOP - the data on disk (EBS) is kept 
* TERMINATE - any EBS (root) will be destroyed
* HIBERNATE
 * RAM is preserved (under the hood - RAM state is written to file in the EBS, EBS must be encrypted)
 * instance boot will be faster
