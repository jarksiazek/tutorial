### Changing instance type
* stop instance
* Instance settings -> Change instance type
* start instance

### Enhance Networking
* installed on new generation instances i.e. t3 
* EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
  * Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), low latency 
  * Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100 Gbps
  * Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - LEGACY
  * Works for new generation instances 
* Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
  * Improved ENA for HPC, only Linux
  * inter-node communications, tighly coupled workloads 
  * Bypasses the underlying Linux OS - low latancy, reliable transport

### Placement groups
EC2 -> Network & Security -> Placement Groups 
* uses for controlling EC2 placement strategy
* 3 strategies:
  * cluster - low-latency in a single AZ, same rack (hardware)
  * spread - max 7 instances per group per AZ - good for critical apps, minimal failure risk
  * partition - many different partitions (hawdwars), spread many different partitions and AZ's, big data apps

### OS Shutdown signal on EC2
* Options
  * Stop (Default) 
  * Terminate (Can be set up from CLI)    

### Termination protection
* protection does not work when shutdown OS is "terminate"

### EC2 Troubleshooting
* # InstanceLimitExceeded - max number of vCPUs per region
  * only apply to running on-demand and spot instances 
  * default is 64 vCPUs - use different region or request AWS 
* # InsufficientInstanceCapacity
  * not enough On-Demand capacity in AZ
  * resolution
    * wait couple mins 
    * request instances one by one
    * instance smaller instance now, and then resize it
    * take different AZ
* # Instance Terminates Immediately
  * EBS limit
  * An EBS snapshot is corrupt
  * the root EBS volume is encrypted and you have permission to KMS for decryption
