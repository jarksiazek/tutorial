### Q1
A developer is migrating on-premise web app to AWS Cloud. The application currently runs on a 32-processor server and stores session state in memory. On Friday afternoons the server runs at 75% CPU utilization, but only about 5% CPU at other times.  
How should the Developer change the code to better take advantage of running in the cloud?
* Compress the session state data in memory 
* Store session state on EC2 instance store
* Encrypt the session state data in memory
* **Store session state in an ElasticCache cluster**
    * Elastic Cache is the perfect solution for managing session state. This is also given in the AWS Documentation.
    * In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for a session that can be accessible from anby individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. A common solution to for this is to leverage an In-Memory key/value store as Redis and Memchached.
